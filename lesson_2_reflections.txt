What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Initializing a repository creates the repository.  There is not one until this is done.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area temporarily holds files so each commit can be planned thoughtfully.
	This allows for more meaningful commits.
