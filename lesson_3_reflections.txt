When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When other people are contributing to the project.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Sometimes changes may not be complete and therefore un-compilable or illogical.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks are copies /w links to original only on github
	Clones are working similars to repositories.
	Branches are alternate paths within one project.
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	This is convenient when internet access may not be available but access to changes made
	on GitHub are desired.  Also, when merging with changes made on GitHub, logs can be
	evaluated to plan the process.
	
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what 
would be harder?

	You could email files back and forth.  This would probably be cumbersome.
	It may be easier to work together in the same room, however this is not always feasible.
	
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? 
What benefits does each approach have?

Changes made on a separate branch can be evaluated before incorporating them into master.
This is a lot more work than just making changes to master.
