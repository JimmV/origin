When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When other people are contributing to the project.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Sometimes changes may not be complete and therefore un-compilable or illogical.
