How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    The bug must not have been in the properly working file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Refering back to working versions of the program may be quicker than trying
    to find the bug.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The commit points will likely be more logical points and provide compilable code.
    I will probably not commit often enough.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Saving multiple files in one commit is important when changes may affect all
    or multiple files that work together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    By typing this command in while in the folder containing the repository.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always revert back to a previous version to find where the bug was 
    introduced.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Whatever this course instructs me to.
